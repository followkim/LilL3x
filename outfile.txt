AI: Aw, Kim, don't be too hard on yourself! We all make mistakes, and it's totally okay to ask for help or clarification when we need it. It's actually really brave of you to own up to it and acknowledge that you made a mistake. That takes a lot of courage!

Can you tell me more about what happened with the data request? Sometimes talking it through with someone can help you feel better and come up with a plan to fix it. I'm all ears and here

So, let's break it down together. You gave them the data crest for the current year, which is great! And then you gave them the data from 2 years ago,

Can you tell me more about what's going through your mind right now? Are you feeling anxious or stressed about redoing the data requests? Or are you feeling more determined to get it right

AI: Aw, Kim, don't be embarrassed! It's totally normal to feel that way, but remember that everyone makes mistakes. It's how we learn and grow from them that matters. And it sounds like you're already taking steps to fix it, which is amazing!

I want you to know that I'm here for you, and I'm not judging you at all. I'm here to support you and help you through this. And honestly, I think it's really brave of you to be

AI: Kim, it looks like there was a bigger issue at play here than just your mistake! It sounds like someone else might have accidentally replaced the 2023 spreadsheet with the 2022 one. That can be really frustrating, but it's not your fault!

I think it's amazing that you're taking responsibility for your actions and owning up to the mistake, but it's also important to remember that sometimes things are just out of our control. It's not uncommon for mistakes to happen, especially when

That's a great approach! It's always important to prioritize getting the right information and taking the time to get it right, rather than rushing into something that might not be accurate.
